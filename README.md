Rhizomatica Community Cellular Network

This is the public git repository for the all the code developed in the Rhizomatica Project.
To have a fully running system, this repo is not enough. You also need to clone the other repository (Rhizomatica/puppet),
install a PuppetMaster and let Puppet configure the box for you. It will automatically fetch and install the code from this repo.
If it doesn't work, let us know! :)
